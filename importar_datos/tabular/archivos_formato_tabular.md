# Lectura de Archivos en Formato Tabular

En este apartado veremos funciones para importar datos en R en formato tabular.



```r
library(tidyverse)
```

## Lectura de Archivos de Texto con `readr`

La mayor√≠a de las funciones del paquete [`readr`](http://readr.tidyverse.org/) est√°n destinadas a convertir [archivos en formato tabular](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valores_separados_por_comas) en `dataframes`:

*`read_csv()` lee archivos en que las columnas est√°n separadas por comas,`read_csv2()` lee archivos separados por punto y coma (comunes en pa√≠ses donde `,` es usada para separar los decimales en los n√∫meros),
`read_tsv()` lee archivos separados por tabuladores, y `read_delim()` lee archivos separados por cualquier otro tipo de delimitador.

*`read_fwf()` lee archivos con un ancho fijo. Podemos especificar los campos o por su ancho con `fwf_widths()` o su posici√≥n mediante `fwf_positions()`.
`read_table()` lee un tipo de variaci√≥n de archivos con un ancho fijo donde las columnas est√°n separadas por espacios en blanco.
  
Estas funciones comparten la misma sintaxis: una vez hemos dominado una,  podemos hacer uso de las otras funciones sin dificultad. Para el resto de este cap√≠tulo nos centraremos en `read_csv`.  No s√≥lo porque los archivos [csv](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valores_separados_por_comas) son una de las formas mas comunes de almacenamiento de datos, sino tambi√©n porque una vez entendamos `read_csv()`, podremos con facilidad aplicar nuestros conocimientos al resto de las otras funciones del paquete `readr`.

El primer argumento en `read_csv()` es el mas importante, puesto que se trata de la localizaci√≥n del archivo que deseamos importar:



```r
df <- read_csv("data/Water_Right_Applications.csv")
```

```
Parsed with column specification:
cols(
  .default = col_character(),
  WR_DOC_ID = col_integer(),
  YEAR_APPLIED = col_integer(),
  CFS = col_double(),
  GPM = col_double(),
  DOMESTIC_UNITS = col_integer(),
  ACRE_FEET = col_double(),
  ACRE_IRR = col_double(),
  WRIA_NUMBER = col_integer(),
  Latitude1 = col_double(),
  Longitude1 = col_double()
)
```

```
See spec(...) for full column specifications.
```

__Observemos__ que cuando ejecutamos la funci√≥n `read_csv` muestra por la consola informaci√≥n relativa al nombre y tipo de cada columna. Esto es una caracter√≠stica muy √∫til en `readr`.
  
Podemos pasar un archivo csv en una sola l√≠nea de c√≥digo. Esto es √∫til para experimentar con `readr` y para crear ejemplos reproducibles que podemos compartir con otros:



```r
read_csv("a,b,c
1,2,3
4,5,6")
```

```
# A tibble: 2 ◊ 3
      a     b     c
  <int> <int> <int>
1     1     2     3
2     4     5     6
```


En ambos casos `read_csv()` usa la primera l√≠nea como nombre de las columnas, lo que es una convenci√≥n generalizada. Existen dos situaciones en las que estar√≠amos interesados en modificar este comportamiento:

1. En ocasiones existen unas pocas l√≠neas de metadatos en la cabecera del archivo. Podemos hacer uso de `skip=n` para descartar las `n` primeras lineas; o usar `comment = "#"` para eliminar todas las l√≠neas que empiezan con `#`.

    

```r
read_csv("La primera linea de metadatos
  La segunda linea de metadatos
  x,y,z
  1,2,3", skip = 2)
```

```
# A tibble: 1 ◊ 3
      x     y     z
  <int> <int> <int>
1     1     2     3
```

```r
read_csv("# Un comentario que deseamos eliminar
  x,y,z
  1,2,3", comment = "#")
```

```
Warning: closing unused connection 5 (https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Anexo:Pa√É¬≠ses_y_territorios_dependientes_por_poblaci√É¬≥n)
```

```
# A tibble: 1 ◊ 3
      x     y     z
  <int> <int> <int>
1     1     2     3
```

2. Los datos podr√≠an no contener columnas con nombres. En esta situaci√≥n podemos hacer uso del argumento `col_names=FALSE` para indicar a `read_csv()` que no trate la primera linea como cabecera, y en lugar etiquete secuencialmente de `X1`a `Xn`:


```r
read_csv("1,2,3\n4,5,6", col_names = FALSE)
```

```
# A tibble: 2 ◊ 3
     X1    X2    X3
  <int> <int> <int>
1     1     2     3
2     4     5     6
```

__Nota__ que hemos usado `"\n"` para a√±adir una nueva linea.

Alternativamente, podemos pasar a `col_names` un vector de caracteres que ser√°      usado para los nombres de las columnas:
  

```r
read_csv("1,2,3\n4,5,6", col_names = c("x", "y", "z"))
```

```
# A tibble: 2 ◊ 3
      x     y     z
  <int> <int> <int>
1     1     2     3
2     4     5     6
```


Otro argumento de gran utilidad es `na`, que especifica el valor (o valores) que son usados para representar los valores desconocidos en nuestro archivo:


```r
read_csv("a,b,c\n1,2,#N/A", na = "#N/A")
```

```
# A tibble: 1 ◊ 3
      a     b     c
  <int> <int> <chr>
1     1     2  <NA>
```

Esto es todo lo que necesitamos saber para importar ~75% de archivos csv que nos encontraremos en la pr√°ctica. Adem√°s, podemos f√°cilmente adaptar lo que hemos aprendido en esta secci√≥n para leer archivos separados por tabulados con `read_tsv()` y archivos con un ancho fijo con `read_fwf()`.
  


## Lectura Archivos Excel con `readxl` 

El paquete [`readxl`](http://readxl.tidyverse.org/) facilita la importaci√≥n de archivos Excel en R. Comparado con la mayor√≠a de paquetes existentes (e.g. `gdata`, `xlsx`, `xlsReadWrite`) `readxl` no requiere de dependencias externas, por lo tanto es m√°s f√°cil de instalar y usar en los sistemas operativos. Como en los apartados anteriores es usado para el trabajo de datos en formato tabular. Este paquete forma parte de la colecci√≥n de paquetes del ecosistema [tidyverse](http://tidyverse.org/) que comparten la misma filosof√≠a y est√°n dise√±ados para trabajar de forma conjunta.

### Instalaci√≥n

El modo m√°s f√°cil de instalar la √∫ltima versi√≥n desde CRAN es instalar el conjunto de paquetes __tidyverse__.


```r
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

Alternativamente, podemos instalar solo `readxl` desde CRAN mediante la siguiente l√≠nea de c√≥digo:


```r
install.packages("readxl")
```

O instalar la versi√≥n en desarrollo desde GitHub:


```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tidyverse/readxl")
```

__NOTA:__ Para esta √∫ltima forma debemos tener instalado el paquete `devtools`.


### Uso del paquete `readxl`

En primer lugar tendremos que cargarlo:


```r
# Cargamos el paquete
library(readxl)
```



La funci√≥n `read_excel()` nos permite leer los archivos tanto si son `xls` o `xlsx` :



```r
hoja_calculo_xlsx <- read_excel("data/Water_Right_Applications.xlsx")
```

Podemos obtener los nombres de las hojas en el libro con la ayuda de la funci√≥n `excel_sheets()`:


```r
excel_sheets("data/datasets.xls")
```

```
[1] "iris"     "mtcars"   "chickwts" "quakes"  
```


Es posible seleccionar una hoja de c√°lculo mediante su nombre o por la posici√≥n que ocupa en el libro:


```r
read_excel(path = "data/datasets.xls", sheet = "quakes")
```




```r
read_excel(path = "data/datasets.xlsx", sheet = 2)
```

El argumento `range` de la funci√≥n `read_excel` nos permite seleccionar un rango de filas y columnas con la misma nomenclatura que utilizamos en Excel:


```r
read_excel(path = "data/datasets.xls", range = "C1:E4")
```

```
# A tibble: 3 ◊ 3
  Petal.Length Petal.Width Species
         <dbl>       <dbl>   <chr>
1          1.4         0.2  setosa
2          1.4         0.2  setosa
3          1.3         0.2  setosa
```

Adem√°s, podemos especificar la hoja del libro de la cual queremos extraer un rango y con el s√≠mbolo l√≥gico de negaci√≥n `!` excluir celdas y columnas en nuestra selecci√≥n:


```r
read_excel(path = "data/datasets.xls", range = "mtcars!B1:D5")
```

```
# A tibble: 4 ◊ 3
    cyl  disp    hp
  <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>
1     6   160   110
2     6   160   110
3     4   108    93
4     6   258   110
```

Por defecto, la funci√≥n `read_excel` trata los campos vac√≠os como valores desconocidos `NA`. En caso contrario, debemos especificarlo en el argumento `na`:


```r
head(read_excel(path = "data/datasets.xls", na = "setosa"))
```

```
# A tibble: 6 ◊ 5
  Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species

3          4.7         3.2          1.3         0.2    <NA>
4          4.6         3.1          1.5         0.2    <NA>
5          5.0         3.6          1.4         0.2    <NA>
6          5.4         3.9          1.7         0.4    <NA>
